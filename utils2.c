/*
1. point to the numbers as index 0 1 2 3 4 ...
to easily sort them

2. calculate how many passes or bits in the max number

2.1 calculate the length of the list

3. check first bit digit if it is 0 push it to stack b
else rotate it,
finally push back all to stack a,

while (i < max_bits)

	while (j < len)
